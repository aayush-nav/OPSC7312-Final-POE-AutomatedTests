## Description of the app

With the help of the *Vitaflex* app, users can manage their daily caloric intake and keep an eye on their weight to support a balanced and healthy lifestyle. The software offers a comprehensive platform for people to meet their health goals and promote long-term wellness by making food management easier.

## Features

* Custom Food and Recipes: Nutrition management is made simple for users by allowing them to log and track custom foods and recipes.
* Personalised Goal Setting: Users can define their health and fitness goals such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance.
* Detailed Progress Tracking: The app provides real-time data on dietary habits, enabling users to monitor their progress with graphs and reports.
* Real-Time Notifications: Custom notifications help users stay on track with meal timings.

## Design Considerations

When designing the Vitaflex app, several key considerations were made:

### User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
Intuitive Navigation:
 The app features a simple and intuitive navigation structure to enhance user experience. Users can easily access meal tracking and recipe sections.

Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience on smartphones and tablets.

### Data Handling
API Integration: The app integrates two APIs:
* Custom API: Handles user-generated data, such as meals and recipes.
* CalorieNinja API: Provides additional nutritional information and meal suggestions.

Data Models: Defined data classes (e.g., Meal, Ingredient) facilitate data management and ensure that the app correctly processes and displays information.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
* Unit Testing: Unit tests are implemented to verify the functionality of critical features, such as API interactions and data handling.
* Automated Testing: Integration tests are executed on every push and pull request to ensure consistent performance and reliability of the app.

## 3. Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions

### Version Control with GitHub

GitHub is utilized as the version control system for the Vitaflex app, enabling collaboration among team members and efficient management of the codebase. Key practices include:

* Branching Strategy: Features and fixes are developed on separate branches, allowing for organized code management and easier merging.
* Pull Requests: Code reviews are conducted through pull requests, fostering collaboration and ensuring code quality.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is employed to automate testing and deployment processes, enhancing the development workflow. The following actions are configured in the .github/workflows folder:

#### GET Meals from the API:

* URL: https://recipe-meal-api-the-a-team.onrender.com/getmeals
* This action verifies that the API is accessible and functioning correctly, ensuring that users can retrieve their meals seamlessly.

#### GET Recipes from the API:

* URL: https://recipe-meal-api-the-a-team.onrender.com/getrecipes
* Similar to the meals endpoint, this action checks the availability of the recipe API, providing users with reliable access to diverse meal options.

#### Generate APK and AAB Files:

* Automated build processes are configured to generate APK (Android Package) and AAB (Android App Bundle) files during every pull and push request.
* This facilitates easy distribution and testing of the app, allowing team members to quickly access the latest build.

## Benefits of Using GitHub and GitHub Actions

* Streamlined Workflow: Automation of testing and deployment reduces manual effort and minimizes errors.

* Improved Collaboration: GitHub provides a platform for team collaboration, enhancing communication and project management.

* Rapid Feedback Loop: Automated tests ensure that any issues are identified early in the development process, leading to quicker resolutions.
